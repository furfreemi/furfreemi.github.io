    <h1>CSRF</h1>
    <p><b>Cross-Site Request Forgery</b></p>
    
    <h2>
        Intro
    </h2>
    <p>
        Cross-site request forgery occurs when a malicious program or site can cause some unwanted action to occur,
        taking advantage of a user being authenticated on that site. A classic example is a user logs in to a vulnerable 
        bank account online portal, does what they need in the portal, and then continues wandering the internet. They end up browsing to a malicious site.
        Without the user realizing it, the malicious site makes a request to the banking site (say, transferring $1000 to the malicious site 
        owner) and since the user is still authenticated with that site from their previous login, the bank accepts that request as legitimate.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Cookies
    </h2>
    <p>
        In order to understand what can allow CSRF to happen, we first need to understand how user logins are managed via our browsers and the sites we access.
        In order to allow users to log in once and then access some private page (such as our bank account portal), browsers maintain 'cookies'. 
        Cookies are small bits of data usually created by a website's server and stored in the browser by sending a response containing a 
        'Set-Cookie' header. The browser will then store and automatically include this cookie in requests back to the server using a 'Cookie' header. This 
        allows the server to keep track of which user is sending each request, and supports functionality such as logging into sites, site customization options 
        (such as a user's language or currency selection), and user tracking. The history behind cookies is that they're a way to add state to the otherwise stateless HTTP.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bringing this back to our bank account portal: when our user logs in to their bank account, they enter a username and password. These values are sent
        to the server via a web request from our browser, and if they are a valid username + password combination, the server's response will include the 'Set-Cookie'
        header along with some cookie details. The browser stores this cookie information, and now every time our user takes some action in the banking portal 
        that triggers a request back to the server, the browser will automatically include this cookie in that request via the 'Cookie' header. This way, the banking
        server can tell that the requests have come from our user. If the cookie is incorrect or missing from this request back to the server, the server could reject 
        the request if it requires authentication or authorization- without a valid cookie, it doesn't know or trust who our user is.

        Blind: takes some action against the site; doesn't need to see response
        
        Attack vectors:
        GET requests (e.g. <img>, <iframe>) - which cannot set headers.
        <form> submitted by a user click - which are limited to a few specific headers.
        <form> submitted by JavaScript (HTMLFormElement.submit()) - which are limited to a few specific headers.

        Login CSRF: get someone to log into your account and add their credit card details. Prevent using pre-session cookie + token before user is even authorized. 
        TODO read: https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf
    </p>
    <p>
        There's two issues at play here: first, the server is only relying on the cookie for auth. If the cookie is included in a request, then the request
        is authorized. This places a huge amount of power into our cookie. The second issue is that our browser is automatically including this cookie in requests,
        regardless of where the request originates from. The malicious site is able to take advantage of these two behaviors: the server has no way of distinguishing
        the malicious request from a legitimate user request, so our bank account is toast.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we've identified some of the issues that allowed this attack to happen, let's move towards some solutions. To address the first issue, 
        we could have the browser only include our banking cookie if the request is sent from the banking site (SameSite cookie options). To address the second, 
        we can explore ways to distinguish malicious requests from legitimate by establishing some secret value known only to our valid origin and our server. The 
        origin can include this value in each request so that the server can validate and differentiate these legitimate requests from malicious. 

        Also consider:
        - Re-Authentication (password or stronger)
        - One-time Token
        - CAPTCHA
    </p>


    <h2>
        Tokens
    </h2>
    <p>
        SOP: restrict JavaScript making cross origin requests with custom headers - will trigger preflight
            - Could theoretically just validate presence of custom header for AJAX calls -> should have originated from same origin (would still need token for forms)
            - Definitely don't add custom header to CORS policy!
        
        'Synchronizer': generate tokens server-side. Generate per session (less secure) or per request (could create issues with back button) and track server
        side, associated with user. Client includes with each request + server validates- reject request if missing or incorrect (+ terminate user session).
        Add to hidden fields or custom header (don't use cookie!). Should not include in 'GET' requests (browser history, logs, etc)

        Encrypted token: don't maintain token server-side. Server generates token by encrypting session ID + timestamp (prevent replay). Included as form field 
        or header in all client requests. Server decrypts + validates (correct session ID compared to currently logged-in user, timestamp not beyond some expiry).

        HMAC token: don't encrypt, instead hash(session ID + timestamp) and concatenate with timestamp. Otherwise same as above.

        Double cookie: on page load, generate separate random cookie for site. Every request includes this cookie value as a form field or param/header. Need to 
        make sure all subdomains are secured and only accept HTTPS connections, since subdomains can set cookies for parent domains.
            - Could encrypt or hash token, set as cookie, and then validate token + cookie match server-side
            - Don't use session ID (prevent exposure to JS via HttpOnly)
            - Protect login page CSRF: ensure browser + form values are aligned
    </p>



    <h2>
        Cookie values + flags
    </h2>
    <p>
        Cookie values: Cannot contain commas, semicolons, or whitespace. 4096 bytes.
        
        Cookie name prefixes: 
            __Secure- : only accept if marked secure and 'Set-Cookie'-triggering request/response was via HTTPS
            __Host- : only accept if marked secure, 'Set-Cookie'-triggering request/response was via HTTPS, does NOT include 'domain', and path is '/'
                - 'domain-locked': doesn't get sent to sub-domains even
                - Can't be overwritten from another subdomain

        Session cookies: non-persistent/in-memory/transient. Web browsers should delete session cookies when users close their browser. 
        Indicated by a lack of expiration date (expires (GMT date) or max-age (seconds) values).

        Note that browsers might not actually hold on to cookies through the expires/max-age specification due to memory or privacy constraints.
        To remove cookies: 'Set-Cookie' with expiration in the past.

        Secure cookies: 'Secure' flag. Will only be sent to server in HTTPS requests (won't be included in HTTP).

        Path: limits scope. 
            - Will INCLUDE in request only if request path matches or is a subdirectory of the cookie's Path value
            - '/' includes all paths
            - If not specified when SET: will be path in the URL of the request

        Domain: will INCLUDE if request sent to exact value of Domain attribute (ex: example.com) or subdomain of Domain attribute (ex: a.example.com) 
            - If domain specification is missing: uses full domain of request; won't be included to subdomains
            - Will only SET cookies for request origin domain or a parent domain (a.example.com can set for a.example.com and example.com, 
            but not b.example.com or b.a.example.com)
            - Leading '.': cookie will be included to subdomains
            - Can't set for 'public suffixes' - com, edu, etc.

        Summary:
        - Ex: Cookie with path '/' and domain 'example.com' will be included for all requests to example.com and its subdomains (a.example.com)
        - Ex: cookie from a.example.com can set cookie with domain a.example.com OR example.com

        HttpOnly: prevent JavaScript access to cookies ('document.cookie'). Not relevant since CSRF doesn't run code on our page or domain.
            - Only displays cookies that apply to current document origin (based on path, domain)
            - Cannot set 'HttpOnly' cookies via JavaScript
        </p>
    <h2>
        SameSite Cookie Options
    </h2>
    <p>
        'Same site' if same second-level and top-level domain (if public suffix + section to the left is the same)
            - a.example.com and b.example.com: considered to be the same site
            - ex1.suffix and ex2.suffix: cross-site- see https://publicsuffix.org/learn/ 
                - ex1.suffixpart1.suffixpart2 and ex2.suffixpart1.suffixpart2: also cross-site


        None: include cookies with cross-site and same-site requests
            - Requires 'Secure' flag
        Strict: only include cookies to site that set the cookie (TODO: subdomains?)
            - Not sent on initial page load via link: logged in user won't appear to be logged in on first load 
                - Ex: clicking private github link would initially fail, even if logged in. On refresh, would work.
        Lax: included via link loads (anything that triggers domain to appear in URL bar) + when same origin
            - Good choice for when cookie is relevant for displaying content
            - Moving towards browser default if SameSite value not specified
                - In Chrome 80. Can test in FF 69.

        Origin verification: 'defense in depth'
    </h2>
    <p>
        Compare Origin or Referer headers (source origin) with target origin. If they match, then request is accepted.
            - Origin + Referer are 'forbidden headers' that only browsers can set
            - Might be omitted in some cases however
            - To find target: Consider proxies: make sure target origin can be identified 
                - Configure server so it knows its own origin value
                - 'Host' header value (may be changed by proxy)
                - 'X-Forwarded-Host' header

    <h2>
        CORS + CSRF
    </h2>
    <p>
        SOP: same origin policy. Javascript only has access to content downloaded from the origin of the page itself, 
        unless the other site sends CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) headers to allow the requestor access.
        - Don't combine CSRF token embedded in page with Access‐Control‐Allow‐Origin: * - else JS of other origin can read response.
        
        Same origin vs cross-origin: 
        - protocol + domain + port
        - Subdomains are cross-origin (will trigger preflight if not 'simple')
        https://httptoolkit.tech/will-it-cors/

        CORS: relaxing of same origin policy. If origin is different + browser determines (headers, method, content type) request is not 'simple', 
        then preflight 'OPTIONS' is triggered. Browser will allow/deny request based on CORS policy response to 'OPTIONS' request.
        - HTML forms, GETs: 'simple'
        Preflight always triggered if cross origin and: 
        - Not GET, POST, or HEAD
        - Not application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain Content-Type

        Policy: 
        Send request (but not necessarily read response):
        - Access-Control-Allow-Origin
        - Access-Control-Allow-Methods
        - Access-Control-Allow-Headers
        - Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: allows cookies cross-origin

        Allow response reading:
        - Access‐Control‐Allow‐Origin + 'Vary: origin'
        Allow reading of custom headers:
        - Access-Control-Expose-Headers
    </p>

        HTTP MITM 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Alternatively, if the parent domain does not use HSTS (header Strict-Transport-Security) with includeSubdomains set
            - HSTS: tell browsers site should only be accessed over HTTPS. includeSubdomains parameter: applies to all of site's subdomains. Will only be observed
            if accessed over HTTP
            - max-age: set to 0 to expire.
            - preload: include to prevent ever accessing via HTTP. Not official. 
        a user subject to an active MitM (perhaps connected to an open WiFi 
        network) could be served a response with a Set-Cookie header from a non-existent sub-domain. The end result would be much the same, with the browser 
        storing the illegitimate cookie and sending it to all other pages under example.com.
