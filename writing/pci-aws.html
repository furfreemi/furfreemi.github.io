    <h1>PCI + AWS</h1>
    <p><b>Acronyms:</b></p>
    <p>PCI = Payment Card Industry</p>
    <p>DSS = Data Security Standard</p>
    <p>PAN = Primary Account Number (Credit Card number)</p>
    <p>CHD = Cardholder data (PAN, cardholder name, expiration date, service code</p>
    <p>CDE = Cardholder data environment</p>
    <p>Sensitive auth data = full track data (mag strip or chip data), CAV2/CVC2/CVV/CID, PIN/PIN blocks. This data must be protected and CANNOT be stored after authorization. CVV = main form of authentication in 'card not present' transactions.</p>
    <p>QSA = Qualified Security Assessor</p>
    <p>ISA = Internal Security Assessor</p>



    <h2>PCI DSS Requirements</h2>
    <p>12 requirements, across 7 domains:
        - Build and maintain a secure network and systems:
            - Install and maintain a firewall config to protect cardholder data
            - Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters
        - Protect cardholder data
            - Protect stored cardholder data
            - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks
        - Maintain a vuln managagement program
            - Protect all systems against malware and regularly update antivirus software
            - Develop and maintain secure systems and applications
        - Implement strong access control measures
            - Restrict access to cardholder data by business 'need-to-know'
            - Identify and auth access to system components
            - Restrict physical access to cardholder data
        - Regularly monitor and test networks 
            - Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data
            - Regularly test security systems and processes
        - Maintain an infosec policy
            - Maintain a policy that addresses infosec for all personnel

        'Requirement 0' prereq: define scope and segmentation boundaries
            - What is in and out of scope for PCI? How to maintain segmentation?
            - Scope = people, processes, and technologies that can impact security of CHD
            - Anything in scope must meet applicable PCI DSS requirements
            - Reduce security surface area -> reduce compliance overhead
    </p>

    <h2>Scoping and Segmentation</h2>
    <p>
        Three scopes:
            - CDE systems (handle CHD)
            - Connected-to or security-impacting systems: systems that have an impact on CDE- direct or indirect filtered connectivity to CDE systems, can affect config or security of CDE systems, or support PCI-DSS requirements
            - Out-of-scope: no access or impact to CDE systems

        Segmentation:
            - Network isolation
            - Data control

        Depends on service type:
            - Infrastructure: EC2, ECS, EKS - segment via network isolation
            - Containerized: RDS, Fargate - segment via network isolation and data control
            - Abstracted: Lambda, S3 - segment via data control
    </p>
    <h2>Segmentation Boundaries on AWS</h2>
    <p>
        3 layers possible:
            - Account
                - Logical isolation of resources from other accounts ('by design' isolation - don't need to validate on your own; AWS has already passed assessment)
                - Use AWS Organizations and SCPs
                - Have dedicated account for CDE systems
                - Have accounts for shared services, logging, security, and connected-to
                - Have account(s) for out-of-scope
                - Master account for managing
                - Non-PCI OU and Core OU, with nested PCI OU.
            - Network
                - SG as segmentation boundaries- stateful virtual firewall
                    - Create in-scope and out-of-scope SGs. Use within connected-to to bridge to in-scope, out-of-scope 
                - Does NOT meet PCI DSS requrements by default (open outbound connection)
                - Could us third-party firewalls
            - Application
                - In scope depending on data handled/stored
                - Application logic to support segmentation
                - Utilize API Gateway to support segmentation between API calls
                - Containers:
                    - Group into related clusters (EC2 launch type) or tasks (Fargate)
                    - Use SGs for cluster/task isolation
        
        Don't forget to consider communications between systems if utilizing hybrid approach.
        Never put more in one account than you'd be willing to have compromised at one time.
        Recommendation:
        - Don't use root organization account for anything. Don't use root account for anything.
        - Route53: different account.
        - KMS: different account.
        - Backups: different account and one-way writing

    <h2>Segmentation Validation</h2>
    <p>
        Requirement 11.3.4: perform a pen test at least annually (biannually for service providers) and after any changes to segmentation controls.
            - Verify all out-of-scope LANs truly have no CDE access
            - Each unique segmentation method should be tested to ensure all security controls are functioning as intended
        
        AWS examples:
            - Account segmentation: validated as part of AWS PCI assessment
            - Network: validate SG ACL via network testing
            - AWS API: validate app logic
            - Custom API: validate network isolation and app logic 
    </p>
    <h2>Lifecycle Management</h2>
    <p>
        - Identify: segmentation boundaries, controls
        - Protect: ensure boundaries are implemented
        - Detect: detect any changes to segmentation boundaries
        - Respond: work/automate to ensure controls are back up
        - Recover: RCA and make changes to processes
    </p>
    <h2>AWS monitoring</h2>
    <p>
        - CloudTrail
        - Inspector
        - VPC Flow Logs
        - AWS Config
    </p>
