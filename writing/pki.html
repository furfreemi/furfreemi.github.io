        Asymmetric Cryptography
    </h2>
    <p>
        Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, is the system made up of two keys- one private
        and one public. A message can be encrypted using a public key and then only decrypted using the private key.
        This is in contrast to symmetric encryption, where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea behind asymmetric encryption is that you keep your private key to yourself (private!) but go ahead and
        hand around your public key to just about anyone. If someone wants to send you a message but ensure that no one
        else can read it, they simply encrypt it using this readily available public key- since you're the only one with
        the private key, no one else can decrypt the message. This enforces 'confidentiality' of the sent message.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Digital signatures
    </h2>
    <p>
        So far, we've talked about asymmetric crypto as a way of sending a secret message to someone- we encrypt with
        their public key, then they are able to decrypt this message using their private key (and since their private
        key is secret, no one else is able to read our message). The public key is used to encrypt, then the private is
        used to decrypt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Asymmetric crypto can be used to authenticate and validate messages as well: that is, ensure a message comes
        from the person you think it is coming from, and that the message hasn't been changed. If we know we have a copy
        of A's public key, they can send out a message encrypted using their private key. If the public key is able to
        decrypt this message, we can trust that the message was sent by A, as only A could have encrypted the message
        using their private key. In order to prevent tampering, A could also calculate the hashed value of the message
        they're sending and then encrypt this value using their private key. When we go to read the message, we can
        check that A's public key can decrypt the included hash value (thus checking that the message was actually sent
        by A), and then recalculate the hash of the message, checking that it matches this included, decrypted value. If
        the message has been changed since A sent it, the hash values won't match- no one but A could replace this
        hashed value as we know it was encrypted with A's private key if we're able to decrypt it with A's public key.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take note of the difference: if we encrypt a message using someone's public key, we can be sure only they can
        read it, as only they have their private key and thus the ability to decrypt our message. However, if we encrypt
        some value using our private key, anyone can decrypt it using our public key, but they will know the value came
        from us if this decryption works as we're the only ones who could have encrypted with our private key. If we use
        our private key to encrypt some message's hash and then send this value along with the message, we can make sure
        the message isn't tampered with: anyone reading the message can decrypt the related value with our public key
        (thus seeing that the message was sent by us) and then validate the message's current hash matches this sent
        hash value (thus checking that the message is in the same state as when we sent it). Note that anyone can read
        the message- there is no confidentiality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also note that the ideas of digital signatures and sending of confidential messages are coupled to two very key
        concepts: first, A has a secret private key that no one else has access to, and we know for certain that we are
        working
        with a copy of the public key associated with A's private key. If this private key is leaked or becomes
        accessible to someone else, we no longer know if a message was sent by A or that our messages can only be read
        by A. Second, if we have a public key that we think is tied to A's private key but is actually tied to
        B's private key, we could end up trusting information sent by B thinking it comes from A, or sending secret
        information to B rather than A.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Certificate Authorities
    </h2>
    <p>
        Certificate authorities (or CAs) are trusted parties that help us address that second issue- how do we make sure
        the public key we're working with when trying to communicate confidentially with A is actually A's public key,
        not some other individual's key who is now intercepting all our communication with A?
    </p>
    <p>
        What CAs do is issue something called a <b>digital certificate</b>, which is basically a public key and a bunch
        of
        ownership information which is then digitally signed by the CA. This enables you to use someone's public key
        with a certain degree of certainty that that key actually belongs to the person you thing it does. This
        naturally leads us to an excellent follow-up question: who are the CAs, and why should we trust them?

        What HTTPS isn't
    </h2>
    <p>
        Example: apple.com vs app1e.com. Sometimes HTTPS could backfire- users see the little padlock and assume a site
        is safe or secure or legit. Just because app1e.com has a CA-signed certificate, that doesn't mean the site
        doesn't have nefarious intentions. HTTPS just means your information is encrypted, and the public key you've
        used to set up that encryption actually belongs to a given site. That site could still be doing totally
        malicious or illegitimate things with the data you're sending it.
