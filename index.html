				<p>
					Hi! My name is Larissa. I'm currently a student at Case Western Reserve University living in the awesome Cleveland, OH.
					I'm slated to graduate in January 2017, and am currently seeking a full time position.
					<br><br>
					I study computer and biomedical engineering, with the intention of going into software engineering. I'm particularly
					interested in software related to the medical or healthcare fields.
					<br><br>
					The past two years, I've interned at a software company working on mobile applications for use in the emergency department,
					both physician-facing and patient-facing. The previous year, I did a 6-month co-op term at a medical imaging company, on their
					infrastructure team. <a href="#projects">Check out my projects!</a>
					<br><br>
					During the school year, I'm a teaching assistant for Case Western's Java and Matlab courses. I've also been involved with the robotics team
					since my freshman year, competing in the NASA Robotic Mining Competition as both a general body member and exec board member.
					I serve as a peer mentor with the Women in Science and Engineering Roundtable (WISER), working with younger undergraduate students interested in pursuing
					an electrical or computer engineering degree at CWRU.
					<br><br>
					I've had the opportunity to work with many programming languages, such as Java, Objective-C, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C, and Verilog,
					as well as other tools including Matlab, Git, Subversion, Inkscape, PhotoShop, and SolidWorks.

				<b>Internships + Co-ops</b>
				<p>
					Summer 2016:
					Emergency departments are fast-paced environment, and small, repeated actions
					such as logging into workstations or managing patient charts can end up consuming
					large amounts of a physician's time. This project further improved physician efficiency
					and patient experience by minimizing required workstation interactions. <br>
					Through mobile integration of physical Bluetooth buttons and a location context-based
					rules engine, this project allows physicians to pair selected button click combinations
					with customizable 'quick actions' to be performed throughout hospital logs and patient
					records. With a simple button press, physicians are able to complete actions such as
					opening a patient's chart or joining a patient's treatment team without having to touch
					a computer, allowing focus to remain on the patient.
					<br>Primary languages: Objective-C, JavaScript
					<br><br>

					Summer 2015: Emergency department visits can be terrifying. Throughout difficult-to-navigate hospitals,
					confusing workflows, long wait times, a constantly-rotating treatment team, and a huge amount of medical
					jargon combined with rushed tests and procedures, there are few environments more stressful for patients.
					<br>I had the opportunity to develop an iOS application for patient use
					throughout an emergency department visit, increasing patient understanding of emergency department
					processes and level of engagement in care. The app facilitates patient comfort through wait and
					result time estimation, customized explanations of procedures and prognoses, simplification of
					communication with staff, and a one-stop resource for test results, final diagnoses,
					and followup instructions.
					<br>Primary language: Objective-C
					<br><br>

					Spring + Summer 2014: Working on the infrastructure team, my project was a 'universal installer' automating a multi-computer
					system setup. My program automated the delivery and installation of customized ISO images from
					a console in order to initialize the specific operating system required by each computer, followed by the automated installation
					of user-selected system packages to specific computers in order to complete setup.
					<br>Primary languages: Java, Python
