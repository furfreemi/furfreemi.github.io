  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer based out of Chicago, although I'm on the road a large amount. I get excited about backend development,
    distributed systems, application security, and am passionate about privacy, freedom, and open access within our digital
    world. I love teaching programming in an accessible and comprehendible fashion. I also love food, climbing, reading, and dogs.
  </p><p>
    I'm not an expert in any of the topics I post about here, however I've found that putting concepts into writing helps me learn
    in more depth and posting these writings holds me accountable to dig deeper and refine my understanding.
    If you have any feedback, please get in touch.
