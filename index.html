					Hi! My name is Larissa. I'm currently a student at Case Western Reserve University living in the awesome Cleveland, OH.
					I'm slated to graduate in January 2017, and am currently seeking a full time position.
					<br><br>
					I study computer and biomedical engineering, with the intention of going into software engineering. I'm particularly
					interested in software related to the medical or healthcare fields.
					<br><br>
					The past two years, I've interned at a software company working on mobile applications for use in the emergency department,
					both physician-facing and patient-facing. The previous year, I did a 6-month co-op term at a medical imaging company, on their
					infrastructure team. <a href="#projects">Check out my projects!</a>
					<br><br>
					During the school year, I'm a teaching assistant for Case Western's Java and Matlab courses. I've also been involved with the robotics team
					since my freshman year, competing in the NASA Robotic Mining Competition as both a general body member as well as exec board member.
					I serve as a peer mentor with the Women in Science and Engineering Roundtable (WISER), working with younger undergraduate students interested in pursuing
					an electrical or computer engineering degree at CWRU.
					<br><br>
					I've had the opportunity to work with many programming languages, such as Java, Objective-C, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C, and Verilog,
					as well as other tools including Matlab, Git, Subversion, Inkscape, PhotoShop, and SolidWorks.
					<br><br>
